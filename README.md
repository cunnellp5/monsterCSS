I will attempt to create the monster in the image using just CSS and post it to
codepen whence i'm ready...

- This is just a means of practice to see if I could create something interesting
- I used SVG html drawings for the first time/ keyframes/ and random techniques with box
shadow where i divide the numbers. Not quite sure what happens there but i got the desired effect.
